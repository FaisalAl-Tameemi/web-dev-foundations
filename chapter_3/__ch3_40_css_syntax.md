# CSS Syntax

In this section, we'll go over the syntax of CSS code. Much like we discussed the anatomy of an HTML tag in the previous chapter, we will go over the anatomy of a single CSS style as an example and we will increase the complexity as we dive deeper into this awesome technology.

Let's breakdown the different components involved in the example above:

1. The __selector__: an indicator to tell the browser which element are we trying to style. There are different types of selectors which we will discuss in the upcoming sections.

2. The __property__: an indicator to tell the browser the property that we would like to style from the element that we selected.

3. The __value__: this is where we specify the value of each property we are using in the current style.

If you're still unsure what each of those components above are doing, don't worry. We will be practicing various types of properties and their values.

_Note:_ Anything that goes between `/* */` inside of a CSS file will be ignored by browser as it's considered a comment (i.e. for humans only).
