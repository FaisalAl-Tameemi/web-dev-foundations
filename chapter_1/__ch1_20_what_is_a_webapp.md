# What's A Web Applicatoin?

Any user interface that can be accessed by a browser is either a website or a web application.

### Websites vs. Web Applications

Let's start with the __websites__:

- Websites are defined by their content.
- The content of websites is usually static (i.e. doesn't change automatically).
- Websites with static content are becoming less common.

This means that if we had a static website which contains a list of blog posts and we wanted to add one more post, then we would actually have to change the code of the website manually. This is compared to dynamic content where we would have the code automatically display new blog posts from the database.


__Web applications__ are also served through a web browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, etc..), they have a few characterstics that are different:

- Web apps are defined by user interactions.
- Web apps have dynamic content and is driven by data.
- A single web app can power multiple websites

With these points above, we can also conclude that most modern websites are actually web apps. For example, a blog that often gets updated is highly likely to be a web app since these blog posts are hard-coded into the website but rather being loaded from a database or a storage service.
