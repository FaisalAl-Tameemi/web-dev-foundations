# HTML Tags

Since all webpages are built on tags, let's breakdown the syntax before looking into the types of tags available for us to use. 

Below is a paragraph (`<p>`) tag example with labels about the different parts of the syntax:

Most tags require an opening and a closing tag, we then place the content inside of the tags.

Tags can also have attributes to tell browsers more about the type of content as well as to quickly identify different tags.

One of those attributes is `id` which could be used as a unique identifier for a certain tags. We will look into uses of the `id` attribute in later sections. 

Each attribute has a value, these attribute-value pairs are placed in the opening tag as is the case with our `<p>` tag above.


### Common Tags

Some common tags in HTML include, `<h1>` for a large heading title:

```html
<h1>
    HTML Tags
</h1>
```

which would produce a title vary similar to the one at the top of this section.

Another widely used tag is the paragraph tag we discussed above. The text you are reading right now is a paragraph.
