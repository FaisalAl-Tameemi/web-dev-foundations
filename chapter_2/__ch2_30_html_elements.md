# HTML Elements

Webpages built with HTML are composed of what we can call `Elements`. These are are the building blocks of what we see in the browser.

Web documents have a number of boxes (“elements”), such as:         `header`, `footer`, `body`, `section`, `paragraph`, etc.

Elements are defined using HTML __tags__ (ex: `<p>` for paragraph).

Without tags, we would just have plain text and webpages would lose structure.
