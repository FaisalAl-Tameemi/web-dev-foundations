# Back-End

The back-end of a web application is composed of a server, an application, and a database (more on this in the next chapter). Back-end development is the practice of building the business logic and the connections required to support the front-end (client side) code.

Some of the responsibilities of back-end developers include:
- Building information servers that respond to requests from the client
- Managing one or more databases of an application
- Syncronizing processes (analytics, file processing, various other use cases)

Some of the common languages used to build back-end code include __NodeJS (Javascript)__, __Ruby__ (usually with Rails), __Python__ and others.
