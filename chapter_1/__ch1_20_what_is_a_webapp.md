# What's A Web Applicatoin?

Any user interface that can be accessed by a browser is either a website or a web application.

### Websites vs. Web Applications

The main differences are as follows: 

- Websites are defined by their content.
- The content of websites is usually static (i.e. doesn't change automatically).
- Websites with static content are becoming less common.

While web applications are also served through a web browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, etc..), they have a few characterstics that are different:

- Web apps are defined by user interactions.
- Web apps have dynamic content and is driven by data.
- A single web app can power multiple websites

With these points above, we can also conclude that most modern websites are actually web apps. For example, a blog that often gets updated is highly likely to be a web app since these blog posts are hard-coded into the website but rather being loaded from a database or a storage service.
