# HTML Buidling Blocks


In this chapter, we will discuss the basics of web pages and __start writing code!!__

Here's an outline:

- We will be familiarizing ourselves with writing HTML code blocks which will help us shape the main structure of our UI (user interface).

- We will practice breaking down the components of webpages we are all familiar with such as Facebook or Twitter.

- We will build our first web page in a mini project towards the end of the chapter.  


__Roll up your sleeves!__
