# Project 1: The Plan

In this section, we will breakdown each component that we have to build on each page of our website and create basic mockups for each page. 

This will help us tremdously down the line as we will have a clear expectation for the main structure / layout of our page.

First, let's have a look at a basic mockup of the home page that we're aiming to build:

Now, let's quickly have a look at the finalized outcome that we will be coding up:

The next part of this section would be to breakdown the final result into boxes (i.e. components / elements).

If we consider the mockup we saw earlier and annotate it with where the think the boxes for each element should be, then we end up with something similar to the following image:
