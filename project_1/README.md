# Project 1: Build A Landing Page

In this chapter, we will build a simple landing page using HTML and CSS. We will also introduce ourselves to tools such as Twitter's Bootstrap to help us get up and running with our project quickly.

We will start with building a plan and making a mockup for what we would like our page to look like at the most basic level.

We will then breakdown the mockups into components that we can actually write into code. After which we will dive into the actual implementation of the code.

__Keep up the great work :)__
