# Front-End

## What Is Front-End Development?

__Front-end web development__ (aka __client-side__ development) is the practice of building user interfaces that live in the browser by writing _HTML, CSS and JavaScript_ (programming languages).

One of the challenges with Front-end development is that the methods and techniques are in constant flux (i.e. they keep changing) to keep up with the requirements of users for a fluid experience.

Another challenge included in Front-end development is that users can arrive to your website through multiple browsers. As a Front-end developer, your responsibility is to ensure that users can always have a great experience being on your website or web application. To achieve this, you must adhere to the different standards and capabilities of each browser, this is called __cross-browser compatibility__ and it is important.

To recap, what we call Front-end is also often referred to as client-side. It refers to the process of writing code that will be run in the browser (ex: Chrome, Firefox, etc..).

Now, since browsers understand HTML, CSS and Javascript, we say that working with these languages to build dynamic user interfaces is Front-end Web Development or UI Development.

In the upcoming chapters, we will get started working with each of the programming languages mentioned above to start building websites!!  :)
