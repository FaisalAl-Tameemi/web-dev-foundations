# Databases

Databases store and retrieve data in organized and reliable ways. 

Databases are also required to have ways of scaling as they usually cater to a high number of request and need to be able to handle with high performance.

The 3 main types of databases are:

1. Relation Databases
2. Document Oriented Databases
3. Graph Databases

Each of the types above have their own strengths and weakneses but the majority of features in a given application can be supported with relational databases.
