# Web Application Components

A website or web application is built from various components interacting together to provide the final result which the user sees on their browser window.

The components that are relevant to web development can be summerized (high-level) as follows:

1. Front-End
2. Back-End
3. Database
4. Infastructure / Hosting

In the next few sections we will dive deeper into each of them but let's go through a high-level view of what each component does:

On the left, __"Device / Client"__, will represent a user's device and is also the __"Front-End"__. This is also where the browser lives. 

The server is where "Database" and the "Back-End" logic lives. Sometimes the Back-End logic is seperated from the database and hosted in 2 different servers.

The Front-End makes requests to the Back-End to load resources and files.
