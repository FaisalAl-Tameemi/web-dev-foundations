# HTML Elements

Webpages built with HTML are composed of what we can call `Elements`. These are are the building blocks of what we see in the browser.

Web documents have a number of boxes (“elements”), such as:         `header`, `footer`, `body`, `section`, `paragraph`, etc.

Elements are defined using `tags`.

Without tags, you just have plain text.
