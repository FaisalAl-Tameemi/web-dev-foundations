# Infrastructure & Hosting

Whenever we build a web application and we want to make it accessible through the internet we have to "host" the web application or website. 

By __host__ we mean put our code on a server (remote computer) and allow users (browsers) to access it on the internet.

There are many companies that provide such services but 2 of the most well-known ones are __Heroku__ and __Amazon Web Services__ (AWS).

As with databases and back-end code in general, we won't be dicussing these topics any further in this e-book and will be focusing on the basics of client side code.
